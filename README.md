This is my first project in ZX Spectrum Z80 for around 30 years. I've forgotten a lot of Z80 over the years so this is a project to help me get my Z80 mojo back.

A Breakout clone is a good place to start as it involves a number of problems to solve:
* Drawing Sprites
* Movement
* Collision Detection
* Scoring
* Keyboard Input
* Sound

With this is mind this project is my playground where I'm experimenting. I'm using Google a lot to help answer questions I have plus the great folks on on the FaceBook Z80 Assembly for ZX Spectrum.

If you are looking to explore Z80 on the ZX Spectrum that group is a great place to see what others are doing and get some help.
