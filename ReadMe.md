This is my first project in ZX Spectrum Z80 for around 30 years and a work in progress. I've forgotten a lot of Z80 over the years so this is a project to help me get back into Z80.

A Breakout clone is a good place to start as it involves a number of problems to solve:
* Drawing Sprites
* Movement
* Collision Detection
* Scoring
* Keyboard Input
* Sound

With this is mind this project is my playground where I'm experimenting. I'm using Google a lot to help answer questions I have plus the great folks on on the FaceBook Z80 Assembly for ZX Spectrum.

If you are looking to explore Z80 on the ZX Spectrum that group is a great place to see what others are doing and get some help.

I've got a number of real ZX Spectrums that I've restored and use for testing my code, but most development is done in my iMac using:

* Pasmo assembler
* Sublime Text 3 with the Z80 Asm syntax highlighting package
* Fuse Spectrum Emulator

This makes development so much easier than it used to be back in the day :o)
